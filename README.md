•	First problem: Implement a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier from scratch to classify patients as diabetic or not using given data. The classifier, written as a class, includes methods for accurate classification and simulating KNN behavior by drawing lines to nearest neighbors (only two examples drawn as points). The code tests different k values and selects the one yielding the highest accuracy as the best choice.

•	Second problem: The code uses a Decision Tree classifier to assign each patient the appropriate medication type. It tests multiple trees, selects the most accurate one based on size, and performs experiments with different train-test split ratios, calculating various metrics and generating plots.
